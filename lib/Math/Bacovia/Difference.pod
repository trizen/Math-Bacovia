=head1 NAME

Math::Bacovia::Difference - Represents a symbolic difference.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use 5.014;
    use Math::Bacovia qw(Difference Symbol);

    my $f = Difference(Symbol('a'), Symbol('b'));
    my $g = Difference(Symbol('x'), Symbol('y'));

    say (($f + $g)->pretty);    #=> ((a + x) - (b + y))

=head1 METHODS

This section describes the methods provided by the B<Math::Bacovia::Difference> module.

=head2 new

    my $obj = Math::Bacovia::Difference->new($minuend, $subtrahend);

Constructs and returns a new B<Math::Bacovia::Difference> object.

=head2 add

    $x + $y
    $x->add($y)

Addition of C<x> and C<y>, using the identity:

    (a-b) + (c-d) = (a+c) - (b+d)

=head2 sub

    $x - $y
    $x->sub($y)

Subtraction of C<y> from C<x>, using the identity:

    (a-b) - (c-d) = (a+d) - (b+c)

=head2 mul

    $x * $y
    $x->mul($y)

Multiplication of C<x> and C<y>, using the identity:

    (a-b) * (c-d) = (a*c + b*d) - (b*c + a*d)

=head2 neg

    -$x
    $x->neg

Additive inverse of C<x>, using the identity:

    -(a-b) = b-a

=head2 eq

    $x == $y
    $x->eq($y)

Return a true value when C<x> and C<y> are symbolically equal.

=head1 SPECIAL METHODS

This section describes the special methods provided by the B<Math::Bacovia::Difference> module.

=head2 inside

    my ($minuend, $subtrahend) = $obj->inside;

Returns the internal values of the self-object.

=head2 alternatives

    my @alt = $obj->alternatives;
    my @alt = $obj->alternatives(full => 1);

This method uses common mathematical identities to create symbolically equivalent expressions from the self-expression.

=head2 pretty

    my $str = $obj->pretty;

Returns a human-readable stringification of the self-expression.

=head2 stringify

    my $str = $obj->stringify;

Returns a stringification of the self-expression.

=head2 numeric

    my $num = $obj->numeric;

Evaluates the self-expression numerically and returns a L<Math::AnyNum> object.
