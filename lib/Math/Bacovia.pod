Math::Bacovia - Symbolic math library with support for alternative representations.

=head1 VERSION

Version 0.01

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<Math::Bacovia> is an experimental symbolic math library, with support for alternative representations, simplification of expressions and numerical evaluation.

    use 5.014;
    use Math::Bacovia qw(:all);

    my $x = Symbol('x');
    my $y = Symbol('y');

    say $x+$y;               #=> Sum(Symbol("x"), Symbol("y"))
    say $x-$y;               #=> Difference(Symbol("x"), Symbol("y"))
    say $x*$y;               #=> Product(Symbol("x"), Symbol("y"))
    say $x/$y;               #=> Fraction(Symbol("x"), Symbol("y"))

    say $x**$y;              #=> Power(Symbol("x"), Symbol("y"))

    say Log($x);             #=> Log(Symbol("x"))
    say Log($x)+Log($y);     #=> Log(Product(Symbol("x"), Symbol("y")))

    say Exp($x);             #=> Exp(Symbol("x"))
    say Exp($x)*Exp($y);     #=> Exp(Sum(Symbol("x"), Symbol("y")))

    say "\n=> Sum:";
    my $sum = Fraction(0, 1);

    for my $n (1..10) {
        $sum += Fraction(1, $n);
    }
    say $sum;                     #=> Fraction(10628640, 3628800)
    say $sum->numeric;            #=> 7381/2520

    say "\n=> Product:";
    my $prod = Product();

    for my $n (1..3) {
        $prod *= Exp(Fraction(1, $n));
    }

    say $prod->pretty;            #=> (exp(1) * exp(1/2) * exp(1/3))
    say $prod->simple->pretty;    #=> exp(11/6)
    say $prod->numeric;           #=> 6.25470095193632871640207...

    say "\n=> Alternative representations:";
    say join ', ', Power(3, 5)->alternatives(full => 1);   #=> Power(3, 5), Exp(Product(Log(3), 5)), 243

=head1 TYPES

The types supported by this library are described bellow:

=head2 Symbol(name, value=undef)

Represents a symbolic value. Optionally, it can have a numerical value (or any other value).

=head2 Number(value)

Represents a numerical value.

=head2 Fraction(numerator, denominator)

Represents a symbolic fraction.

=head2 Difference(minuend, subtrahend)

Represents a symbolic difference.

=head2 Power(base, power)

Represents a symbolic exponentiation in a symbolic base.

=head2 Log(x)

Represents the natural logarithm of a symbolic value.

=head2 Exp(x)

Represents the natural exponentiation of a symbolic value.

=head2 Sum(a, b, c, ...)

Represents a summation of an arbitrary (finite) number of symbolic values.

=head2 Product(a, b, c, ...)

Represents a product of an arbitrary (finite) number of symbolic values.

=head1 EXPORT

Importing a name from B<Math::Bacovia> can be done using the following syntax:

    use Math::Bacovia qw(Fraction);     # imports the Fraction() function

=head2 i / e / pi / tau

B<Math::Bacovia> also provides a small list of useful constants which can be imported:

    i      the imaginary unit                sqrt(-1)
    e      the e mathematical constant       Exp(1)
    pi     the PI mathematical constant      Log(-1) * -sqrt(-1)
    tau    the TAU mathmematical constant    Log(-1) * -sqrt(-1) * 2

For importing a constant, the same syntax can be used as in importing a function:

    use Math::Bacovia qw(i tau);

By specifying the B<:all> special keyword, B<Math::Bacovia> will export all the provided functions and constants.

    use Math::Bacovia qw(:all);

Nothing is exported by default.

=head1 SPECIAL METHODS

Each type provided by B<Math::Bacovia> includes the same set of methods, defined bellow:

=head2 alternatives

    $x->alternatives(%opt)

This method uses common mathematical identities to create symbolically equivalent expressions from the self-expression.

Example:

    say for Exp(Log(Fraction(1,3)) * 2)->alternatives;

Output:

    Exp(Product(2, Log(Fraction(1, 3))))
    Power(Fraction(1, 3), 2)
    Exp(Product(2, Log(1/3)))
    Power(1/3, 2)

The options supported by this method are:

    log  => 1,    # will try to generate logarithmic alternatives
    full => 1,    # will try to generate more alternatives (it may be slow)

Example:

    say for Power(3, 5)->alternatives(full => 1);

Output:

    Power(3, 5)
    Exp(Product(Log(3), 5))
    243

B<WARNING:> The number of alternative representations grows exponentially! For non-trivial expressions,
this process may take a very long time and use lots of memory. In combination with the B<full> option
(set to a true value), the returned list may contain hundreds or even thousands of alternative representations.

=head2 simple

    $x->simple(%opt)

Returns a simplification of the self-expression, taking the same options as the C<alternatives()> method.

    say Exp(Log(Log(Exp(Exp(Log(Symbol('x')))))))->simple;

Output:

    Symbol("x")

The simplification of an expression is done by generating the list of
alternative representations for it, then selecting the shortest expression from this list.

This approach works pretty well even on relatively complex expressions, such as:

    say Log(Symbol('x'))->cosh->simple->pretty;     #=> ((1 + x^2)/(2 * x))

However, the returned simplified expression is not guaranteed to always be "optimal". In some cases, calling the C<simple()>
method on an already simplified expression, the simplified expression may get simplified even further:

    $x->simple(full => 1)->simple(full => 1);

B<WARNING:> On long expressions, this process may take a very long time and use lots of memory.

=head2 expand

    $x->expand(%opt)

Returns an expanded version of the self-expression, taking the same options as the C<alternatives()> method.

    say Power(Fraction(5, 7), Fraction(1, 3))->expand(full => 1);

Output:

    Exp(Product(Log(Fraction(5, 7)), Fraction(1, 3)))

The expansion of an expression is done by generating the list of
alternative representations for it, then selecting the longest expression from this list.

B<WARNING:> On long expressions, this process may take a very long time and use lots of memory.

=head2 numeric

    $x->numeric

Evaluates the self-expression numerically and returns the result as a L<Math::AnyNum> object.

Example:

    my $x = Symbol('x', 13);
    my $expr = ($x**2 - $x + 41);

    say $expr->numeric;   #=> 197

=head2 pretty

    $x->pretty

Returns a human-readable stringification of the self-expression.

Example:

    say Power(3, Log(Fraction(1, 2)))->pretty;    #=> 3^log(1/2)
